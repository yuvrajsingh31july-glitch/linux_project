As a technologist, I depend on the foundations laid by others before me. 
Every day, I use tools like $TOOL to perform my work and grow my skills. 
Open source represents the spirit of collaboration where the pursuit of knowledge outvalues corporate walls.

To me, freedom means $FREEDOM. It means the right to look inside the machine, understand how it ticks, and fix it if it breaks. 
To honor the open-source philosophy, if I could share one creation with the world, I would build $BUILD and license it openly for anyone to use, learn from, and adapt.
