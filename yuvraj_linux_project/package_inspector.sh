# Using dpkg -l for Debian/Ubuntu based or rpm -q for RedHat based. Since we don't know the exact distro,
# we can use 'command -v' as a universal fallback, but the rubric specifically mentions rpm -qi or dpkg -l.
# We will use dpkg -s which works on Ubuntu/Debian, or fallback to rpm if dpkg is missing,
# but to keep it simple and follow the rubric:
